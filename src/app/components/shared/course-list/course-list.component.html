<!--
  This is the course list component. It lists the courses that it's being passed
  as Input(). For a user, it displays the courses of a given category. Every course
  can be opened separately by navigating to the specific course route, by id. While
  used for the admin - this component displays all the courses and offers the ability
  to create a new course, edit or remove an existing course.
